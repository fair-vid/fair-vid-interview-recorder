# FAIR-VID Mock Interview Dataset Generator

**Create your own video interview dataset for testing transparent AI systems**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Latest Working Version
Use the shared Colab link (always up-to-date):
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mqcCrypaK3u_kvs7nSqX4XTvBgq4-shK?usp=sharing)


## 🎯 Purpose

This tool helps you create realistic mock video interview datasets that can be used to test and understand how AI systems analyze video interviews in university admissions or job applications. It's part of the FAIR-VID research project on transparent, human-centered AI in organizational processes.

### Why This Matters

Many universities and companies now use AI to analyze video interviews, but these systems are often "black boxes" - you can't see how they work. Our research aims to make AI in high-stakes decisions transparent and fair. This notebook lets **anyone** create test datasets to:

- Understand what AI "sees" in video interviews
- Test AI systems on your own computer
- Practice answering interview questions
- Help researchers build better, fairer AI systems

## 📦 What You Get

This repository contains:

1. **Interactive Notebook** - Record video interview responses directly in your browser
2. **Question Bank** - Pre-loaded interview questions from various study programs
3. **Easy Export** - Save your recordings to Google Drive in standard MP4 format
4. **No Installation Required** - Runs entirely in Google Colab (free)


### Option 2: Stable Version (will be added later)
1. Download the notebook from this repository: `RecordVideo.ipynb`
2. Follow the 4 steps inside the notebook


## 📋 How It Works

The notebook has 4 simple steps:

### Step 1: Select Questions ⁉️
- Choose your study program from the dropdown menu
- Browse available interview questions
- Select which questions you want to answer
- See total estimated time

### Step 2: Initialize Camera 📸
- Grant camera and microphone permission in your browser
- One-time setup (your browser will remember)

### Step 3: Start Recording 🎙️
- Click "Start Recording" button
- Answer questions one by one
- Each recording saves automatically
- 3-second countdown before each question

### Step 4: Save to Drive 💾
- Convert videos to MP4 format
- Upload to your Google Drive
- Organized by study program

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

**Your data stays private:**
- Videos are stored in YOUR Google Colab session
- Only saved to YOUR Google Drive (if you choose)
- No data is sent to external servers
- You control what happens to your recordings

**Ethical Use:**
- Create mock datasets for research and testing
- Practice interview skills
- Understand AI systems better
- Help build transparent AI


## 🎓 For Students

This tool can help you:
- **Practice** answering interview questions before real applications
